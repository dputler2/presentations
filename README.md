# Materials from Dan Putler's Presenations

The purpose of the repository is to give people access to presenations I've made in public presenatations. Typically, this will involve PDF files of the slides I used, but at other times, it may include script and data files used to create presentation materials. Each presenation is contained in its own folder.
